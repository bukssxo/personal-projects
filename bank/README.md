THE PROBLEM:


Alice has lost gender information of a new customer and does not know whether to make a skirt or a trouser.
However, she knows that customer males order trousers and females skirts. She is planning to throw a fair
coin. Moreover, we know that Alice has data about existing customersâ€™ waist and hip measurements as well as
their gender. Given that Alice has the measurements for this new customer, explain how she can make a
better decision using a machine learning algorithm?

Consider the dataset bank.csv from the marketing department of a bank. The given dataset is about whether
customers subscribed to a term deposit given some information about them and how the bank has engaged
and reached out to the customers to sell the term deposit. We would like to build up a logistic model in order
to predict the customers who did subscribe to a term deposit.
